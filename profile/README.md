# 🌍 CapturGO

**CapturGO** is the decentralized mobility app that rewards you for your movement.  
Built on the principles of **DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks)**, CapturGO transforms your location data into value — giving you ownership, rewards, and insight as you move through the world.

## 🚀 Overview

Every step, drive, and route tells a story.  
CapturGO captures that story — securely and privately — while rewarding you for contributing to a global, user-owned mobility network.

Unlike traditional apps that collect and monetize your data without consent, CapturGO puts you in control.  
You earn points and rewards simply by moving, helping build a decentralized network that powers real-world intelligence for navigation, mapping, and urban development.
